# Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration System

A comprehensive agent-based architecture for automating business operations with robust error handling, monitoring, scheduling, and integration with various business systems.

## Overview

This system implements a sophisticated multi-agent framework designed to automate and orchestrate business operations across different departments. It leverages AI agents to handle tasks in customer support, sales, development, marketing, administration, design, and finance, all coordinated by a top-level orchestration agent.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different business functions
- **Task Prioritization**: Dynamic task scheduling with priority queues
- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic retries and human escalation for failed tasks
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track agent performance and system metrics
- **Scheduling System**: Automated daily, weekly, and hourly task scheduling
- **Business System Integration**: Connectors for CRM, Slack, GitHub, Figma, QuickBooks, and more
- **Memory Management**: Vector-based memory store for agent context persistence

## Architecture

The system is built around these key components:

- **AgentSystem**: The main controller that manages agents, tasks, and connectors
- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents for different business functions
- **Tasks**: Units of work with priorities, dependencies, and status tracking
- **Connectors**: Integration points with external business systems
- **Memory Store**: Persistent storage for agent context and knowledge

### Agent Types

1. **Customer Support Agent**: Handles support tickets with sentiment analysis and knowledge retrieval
2. **Sales Agent**: Manages leads, qualifies prospects, and updates CRM
3. **Development Agent**: Reviews code, allocates tasks, and monitors project progress
4. **Marketing Agent**: Creates content, analyzes audience data, and optimizes campaigns
5. **Admin Agent**: Schedules meetings, manages documentation, and allocates resources
6. **Design Agent**: Analyzes requirements, creates prototypes, and processes feedback
7. **Finance Agent**: Handles invoicing, expense processing, and financial reporting
8. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates all agents and manages system-wide workflows

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  - google-adk
  - schedule
  - pyyaml
  - (other dependencies based on connectors used)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-orchestration-system.git
cd agent-orchestration-system
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate a default configuration:
```bash
python main.py --generate-config
```

4. Update the configuration with your API keys and settings.

## Configuration

The system uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
api_keys:
  search: "YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY"
  crm: "YOUR_CRM_API_KEY"
  slack: "YOUR_SLACK_API_KEY"
  # Additional API keys...

agent_settings:
  default_model: "gemini-1.5-flash"
  code_model: "gemini-1.5-pro"
  response_model: "gemini-1.5-pro"
  # Additional model settings...

memory_settings:
  vector_db_path: "./vector_db"
  dimension: 1536

max_workers: 10

connectors:
  crm:
    base_url: "https://api.crm.example.com/v1"
    sync_interval: 3600
  slack:
    channels: ["general", "support", "sales", "engineering"]
  # Additional connector configurations...

scheduling:
  daily_start: "08:00"
  daily_end: "18:00"
  weekend_monitoring: false
```

### API Keys

You'll need to obtain API keys for each service you want to integrate with. Update the `api_keys` section in the configuration file with your actual keys.

### Agent Models

The system uses Google's Gemini models for agent intelligence. You can specify different models for different agent types based on their needs. For example, more complex tasks like code review or content generation might benefit from Gemini Pro, while simpler tasks can use Gemini Flash.

## Usage

### Starting the System

To start the agent system:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

For verbose logging:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml --verbose
```

To run as a daemon in the background:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml start --daemon
```

### Managing Tasks

The system comes with a CLI for managing tasks:

Add a new task:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml add-task --id "task-123" --description "Review weekly sales data" --agent finance --priority HIGH
```

List tasks:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml list-tasks
```

Filter tasks by status:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml list-tasks --status COMPLETED
```

### Monitoring Performance

View system-wide performance:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml performance
```

View performance for a specific agent:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml performance --agent customer_support
```

### Stopping the System

To stop the running system:
```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml stop
```

## Scheduling

The system automatically schedules tasks based on daily, hourly, and weekly patterns:

- **Morning Routine**: Reviews overnight support tickets, prepares standup agenda
- **Evening Routine**: Generates end-of-day summary, updates financial positions
- **Hourly Checks**: Monitors for new support tickets, checks development progress
- **Weekly Planning**: Prepares sprint planning, content calendars, and cash forecasts
- **Weekly Review**: Generates performance reports and metrics analysis
